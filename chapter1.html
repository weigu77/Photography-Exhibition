                            <p>Descripition:Tiananmen Square, located in the center of Beijing and nestled between numerous historical sites and modern architecture, is the largest urban central square in the world. It is not only a symbol of China but also a landmark that embodies profound historical and cultural value as well as significant political meaning.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In the year 1417, at the age of only 18, Kuai Xiang was appointed by the Yongle Emperor Zhu Di as the chief engineer for the construction of the Imperial City in Beijing. He took on the heavy responsibility of designing and constructing the Imperial City, which included Tiananmen. During that era, architectural technology was relatively underdeveloped, lacking modern machinery and precise measurement tools; nevertheless, Kuai Xiang, through his wisdom and talent, created an astonishing architectural marvel. <br>
            During a construction project, a careless craftsman accidentally shortened a piece of precious wood. This was a serious mistake, but Kuai Xiang cleverly transformed the shortened wood into a beautiful threshold, showcasing his wisdom and adaptability. He not only remedied the craftsman's error but also turned this threshold into a striking feature at Tiananmen. This story is still celebrated today, and Kuai Xiang is thus honored with the title 'Kuai Luban'.</p>

                            <p>Beijing, this ancient yet modern city, carries a millennia of history and culture. Every brick, every wall tells its own story. Stepping into the Forbidden City feels like traveling back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The red walls and green tiles, resplendent in gold, reveal the royal nobility and solemnity at every corner. This place is not only a treasure of ancient Chinese architecture but also a witness to history.</p>

It is situated at the center of Beijing's central axis. The Palace Museum is one of the largest and best-preserved wooden structure ancient architectural complexes in the world.</p>

                        <p>Houses in the Forbidden City: There are 9,999 houses in the Forbidden City, and the copper nails on each door are 9 horizontal and vertical, this strange number phenomenon is related to the ancient Chinese's understanding of numbers. The ancients believed that "9" was the largest number in the number, and the emperor was also the largest in the world, so the corresponding 9 should be used. The homonym of "9" is "long", which means "forever", and it also means that the country will last forever and will never change color.</p>

                            <p>Descripition:The Temple of Heaven, originally named the 'Altar of Heaven and Earth', served as a place for the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties to conduct 'heavenly sacrifices' and 'prayers for grain'. Covering a total area of 273 hectares, it is the largest existing ancient sacrificial building in China.</p>

                        <p>The Temple of Heaven in Beijing is a treasure trove that embodies a rich history and profound culture. Entering the Temple of Heaven feels like stepping into a tunnel of time. The ancient architecture exudes an air of mystery, with red walls and blue tiles particularly solemn under the sunlight. The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, a unique circular structure, features a triple-eaved, pointed roof that resembles a magnificent crown. The blue glazed tiles symbolize the blue sky, representing the ancients' reverence and supplication to the heavens.</p>
                        <p>One night, the Emperor dreamed that he was thirsty and searched for water, but the land was vast and desolate without any sources of water. Then, a robust man appeared, his body glowing red, and informed him, "If the Empress prays for rain, it will surely come." The next day, the Emperor believed it was a divine message, and thus issued an edict for the Empress to pray for rain for three days; if it did not rain, she was forbidden to return to the palace.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the location for seeking rain, there were numerous discussions among the officials. Ultimately, the last elderly gentleman with white hair, relying on the 'Zuo Zhuan', proposed the area to the south of the state gate, specifically to the left side of the main road outside the Zhengyangmen, which corresponds to the southern suburbs and to the left of the state gate. The ministers then invited geomancy masters, who ultimately selected the site at the Round Altar south of the Temple of Heaven, where there is a small loess hill, which the geomancer claimed is favorable for weather.</p>

                            <p>The Summer Palace, a royal garden from the Qing Dynasty in China, is the most well-preserved royal imperial garden, often referred to as the Museum of Royal Gardens. The most prominent feature of the Summer Palace lies in the perfect combination of its natural landscape encircled by mountains and water with the grand architectural style of the royal palaces.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As the wheels of history slowly roll into the western suburbs of Beijing, the Summer Palace, an ancient royal garden, stands like a thick tome of history, quietly narrating thousands of years of Chinese civilization. It is not merely a garden; it is a culmination of traditional Chinese culture. The architectural style of the Summer Palace integrates the essence of classical Chinese gardens and royal architecture.</p>
                    <p>In 1888, Empress Dowager Cixi utilized funds under the pretext of raising navy expenses for reconstruction, later proposing in the name of Emperor Guangxu to restore the Qingyi Garden, in imitation of their ancestors (Qianlong), as the venue for her sixtieth birthday celebration, renaming it 'Summer Palace' to emphasize the Empress Dowager's wish for 'nurturing longevity' and 'harmonious enjoyment of life.' The reconstruction project continued until 1894, when it was basically completed, coinciding with the Empress Dowager's sixtieth birthday. Upon entering the Summer Palace, one often hears the phrase 'Golden Mountain and Golden Sea.' 'Golden Mountain' refers to Wanshou Mountain, which resembles a green dragon lying across the northern part of the Summer Palace. 'Golden Sea' denotes Kunming Lake, which is vast and occupies approximately three-quarters of the Summer Palace's area.</p>

                        <p>The coffered ceiling, the most mysterious art of ceiling in ancient architecture, serves not only as decoration but also reflects the ancients' imagination and reverence for the universe! From the Han Dynasty to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the evolution of coffered ceilings has carried a thousand years of cultural heritage, with every carving and every brush stroke of color standing as a testament to history.</p>
                        <p>Most ancient architecture was constructed with wooden structures. Wood is susceptible to fire, and water can extinguish fire; thus, to counteract the menace of fire, the ancients would create wells at the highest points of their halls and towers, praying for divine protection. The term '藻' refers to aquatic algae, while '井' denotes a water well.This Zaojing (藻井) is divided into five levels, with each circular main frame intricately carved with cloud patterns. At the very top of the zhaojing lies a celestial diagram depicting over 1,400 stars. It is said that this diagram was created based on a star map from the Tang dynasty, and expert analysis has confirmed that the quantity and positions of these stars are remarkably accurate. Hanging beneath the ceiling occupied by the statue of the Buddha, the first four levels are adorned with heavenly palaces representing celestial realms, while below the heavenly palace are painted images of the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The palaces are populated by immortals and celestial maidens, with their expressions and postures rendered in exquisite detail. Surrounding the zhaojing, there is a square well-beam that aligns with the indoor ceiling and the first level of the zhaojing, upon which stand numerous divine figures amidst swirling colorful clouds. Moreover, beneath this celestial ceiling—at the corners of the zhaojing's third level—there are wooden carvings of the Four Heavenly Kings providing support.</p>

The geometric deconstruction of the CCTV Building, affectionately known as the 'Big Pants,' exemplifies modern aesthetics; the Bird's Nest and the Technology Building complement each other, while the Water Cube shimmers with radiant waves and the China World Trade Center Tower stands tall against the skyline. The National Grand Theatre is a play of light and shadow, rich in artistic atmosphere; the Chinese Archaeological Museum embodies historical memories, and the Olympic Tower rises to the clouds, witnessing moments of glory. Each site showcases the distinctive charm of modern architectural design. They are not only iconic buildings of the city but also vivid representations of Beijing's modernization process.</p>

                            <p>Photographer: Mingdi Yu</p>

                            <p>Descripition:The meaning of the Central Television Headquarters Building (often referred to as the 'Big Underpants') can be interpreted in multiple dimensions. From an architectural perspective, it reflects modern urban design concepts and cultural symbolism, while public discourse tends to focus on two main viewpoints: controversies related to feng shui and interpretations involving reproductive metaphors.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>This building was designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and German architect Ole Scheeren. The appearance of the new CCTV headquarters is extremely modern; however, its design inspiration is rooted in traditional Chinese culture, incorporating the philosophical concept of 'unity between nature and humanity.' The design of the building also fully considers its integration with the environment, with its slanted shape aimed at minimizing the obstruction of the surrounding environment, allowing sunlight and wind to freely pass through the structure, thereby creating a more pleasant microclimate for the city.</p>
                        <p>The building consists of two leaning towers and a horizontal cantilever, forming a circular structure in the shape of a 'Z'. This design breaks away from the traditional 'straight up and down' model of high-rise buildings, presenting significant technical challenges. To address issues related to gravity and wind loads, architects collaborated closely with structural engineers, optimizing the design through computer simulations and experiments.</p>

                            <p>The Bird's Nest, namely the National Stadium, impresses every person who approaches it with its unique shape and grand momentum. It was designed in collaboration between Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron and the China Architecture Design and Research Group. From a distance, the intricate steel structure resembles a nest meticulously constructed by birds in nature, filled with vitality and energy</p>

                            <p>Descripition:The "Bird's Nest," hailed as a great architectural work of the "fourth generation of sports venues," satisfies all the functional and technical requirements of an Olympic stadium while being designed without being dominated by overly emphasized architectural technologies such as large-span structures and digital screens.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The official name is rather prosaic, but everyone and their mum knows this centerpiece of the Olympics by its well-loved nickname, the “Bird’s Nest”. Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are actually not in favor of this moniker; they prefer multiple ways of perceiving a building. Contrary to its seemingly random appearance, strict rule-based methods were employed in the stadium’s construction, and each half of the 44,000 ton-steel shell is basically identical in design. Spectators benefit from natural air circulation inside, while a translucent membrane provides protection from the rain. Come evening time, the Bird’s Nest puts on its swankiest appearance: A glimpse of the stadium’s reflection off the surrounding moat will have you reaching for your camera. During the Olympics, Usain Bolt decisively shattered both the men’s 100m and 200m world records here. Post-Olympics, a different kind of race takes place, as masses of tourists scramble to get tickets to enter during weekends and holidays. (A staggering 527,000 visitors arrived on October 2, 2008, alone.)</p>

                            <p>The Water Cube, officially known as the National Swimming Center, resembles a dreamlike blue crystal box.

                            <p>Descripition:The National Aquatics Center, also known as the 'Water Cube' and 'Ice Cube,' is a premium venue for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and a classic renovation site for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. It is also the only Olympic venue funded by donations from compatriots from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese. It has been recognized as one of the 'Top Ten New Architectural Wonders of China'.</p>

                        <p>The night view of the Water Cube is something you should not miss. It lights up with blue lights, resembling a glittering blue ocean in the dark night, creating a dazzling sight that is perfect for photography and sightseeing. Spend an evening there — you wouldn't regret it.</p>
                        <p>At night, the Bird's Nest illuminates with red lights, resembling a burning flame. The blue lights of the Water Cube and the red lights of the Bird's Nest form a striking color contrast, complementing each other and adding a touch of charm to Beijing's nightscape.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The China World Trade Center Phase I project began in 1985, at a time when China was just recovering from economic difficulties. This project is one of the largest foreign-invested projects in terms of single investment scale in China. Due to prolonged economic hardship, the construction organization capabilities of China's construction industry lagged significantly behind those of developed countries. In international bidding, Chinese construction enterprises were even ineligible to apply, with most specialized subcontracting being acquired by foreign companies. The Phase I project epitomized the most advanced construction technologies of the time and presented a significant challenge and learning opportunity for Chinese construction enterprises.</p>
                    <p>The China World Trade Center complex is not only a city landmark in Beijing but also a vivid reflection of China's reform and opening-up as well as the development of its construction industry. From the completion of Phase I to Phase III of the complex, it has witnessed China's transformation from a follower to a leader, showcasing the resilience and innovative capabilities of the country's construction sector. The involvement of two generations, father and son, endows this history with a unique cultural significance.</p>

                            <p>Descripition:The Chinese Archaeological Museum is a large historical archaeology museum established under the Chinese Academy of History. It is the first museum in China to be named after archaeology. The exhibits mainly consist of archaeological discoveries, and also include precious ancient books and archival documents.
                                In 1976, an exquisite ivory cup was unearthed from the tomb of Fu Hao in the Yin Ruins of Anyang, Henan. Fu Hao was known as the 'first female warrior' during the reign of King Wu Ding of the Shang Dynasty, and this cup served as her burial artifact. In ancient times, ivory was a rare resource; to possess an ivory cup indicated one was either wealthy or noble. It not only symbolized status but also served as a totem of power. The people of the Shang Dynasty believed in treating the deceased as living; thus, Fu Hao took it with her to the grave, possibly hoping to enjoy fine wine in another world or to demonstrate her authority as a 'female general.' Furthermore, most patterns on the ivory cup are associated with sacrifices and mythology, and each line of the design conceals the ancient people's reverence for the deities of heaven and earth.
