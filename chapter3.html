        <h1>Chapter3.The English narrative - a stone-built poem of civilization</h1>
        <p>When the bells of Big Ben resonate with the paintings of the National Gallery in London, when the angel lamps of Regent Street illuminate the antiquities of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, when the stained windows of Birmingham Cathedral and the Rosetta Stone of the British Museum reflect in the distance, we see how the British Isles write civilization through architecture. These landmarks are not only masterpieces of stone, wood and steel, but also living archives of thousands of years of history. These solidified movements invite you to listen to the past as told by the stone and to think about how it illuminates the future.</p>

            <p>When the security guards discovered that the cleaners were using Rembrandt's "Batavians' Oath" as a rag stand, the management finally realized the drawbacks of elitism. Since then, the museum has removed the threshold: the entrance fee has been abolished, the opening has been extended to night, and a café has been set up in the exhibition hall. In 2013, Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" before the live broadcast of the marriage proposal marked its complete transformation into a "national living room". Today, art students take their seats in front of "Portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Arnolfini" every morning, and the "miniature exhibition" on the basement floor allows blind people to touch the texture of famous paintings through 3D printing – these may be a better interpretation of the word "country" than those collections worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

            <p>During the 21st century renovation, the designers found that the 18th-century architectural drawings read: "Preserve the shelter of the north porch for wanderers". The tradition continues today: the church provides hot water and breakfast to the homeless every morning, and the story of The Good Samaritan on stained-glass faces the soup kitchen, echoing more than 300 years. Perhaps the most striking thing about this building is not its baroque curves, but the fact that it is like the city of Birmingham – between the chimneys and the steeples of the church, it always guards the light of humanity</p>

            <p>During a recent overhaul, workers discovered relics of Victorian workers at the spire of the bell tower:</p>
            <p>A tin box containing shredded tobacco containing an 1883 newspaper</p>
            <p>A note written in pencil: "We will rest here at 3 p.m. on May 21"</p>
            <p>A few rusted pennies (exactly the same coins used to adjust the clocks back then)</p>
            <p>The items were put back as they were, adding the smartphones of today's maintenance workers and the Covid masks, forming a conversation that spanned 140 years.</p>

            <p>British Museum: Between 1980 and 1987, a black-and-white cat named Mike became the legendary "curator" of the British Museum. It was originally a stray cat, and was accepted by the museum as an official rat catcher for its ability to catch mice. Mike's main role is to patrol the Greco-Roman galleries at night to protect precious artifacts from rodent infestation. According to the museum's archives, it managed to capture dozens of rats during his seven years in office, making him one of the museum's most competent "security guards". Interestingly, Mike's attitude towards the museum's various exhibits is very different. It especially hates the smell of mummies in the Egyptian pavilion, makes detours every time it patrols, but has a soft spot for the Chinese porcelain gallery. Scholars speculate that this may be due to the special mineral smell of the cobalt material used in Ming Dynasty blue and white porcelain, which attracted this cat full of artistic taste.</p>

            <p>In the early days of the museum's construction, the budget was tight, and the administrator came up with a strange income-generating plan: pay 1 pence to touch the Egyptian mummy, add 2 pence to lift the shroud to see the face, and even allow to tear off a bandage as a souvenir until 1820, which was not stopped until 1820, resulting in serious damage to many mummies.</p>
            <p>The Stradivari's famous piano "Messiah" (worth more than $20 million) was secretly hidden in a bank vault in Oxford during World War II. But the administrator and the banker didn't trust each other at the time of the handover, which eventually evolved into:</p>
            <p>The bank sent someone to escort the empty case to the museum at gunpoint</p>
            <p>The real piano was disguised as a cheap instrument and transported by bicycle by the professor</p>
            <p>This experience was later adapted into the 007 novel Dawn of Life.</p>
            <p>The magic of this museum lies in the fact that it is both a temple of serious scholarship and an attic full of human mischiefs and whimsy</p>

            <p>The "Declaration of Light" for Postwar Rebirth (1954)</p>
            <p>The prototype of the angel lamp was born during the reconstruction of London after World War II. In 1954, in order to boost the morale of the citizens, the merchants of Regent Street hung simple angel lamps for the first time – made of ordinary incandescent light bulbs and metal skeletons at the time, but they became a "symbol of hope" in the era of scarcity. An old Londoner recalled: "On the first Christmas after the war, the whole street was crowded with people looking up at the lights, and many people cried while watching. "These angel lamps have long since transcended the meaning of commercial decoration, they carry the optimism of Londoners from the ruins of the war to the haze of the pandemic. As The Guardian wrote: "When the angels of the winter night are lit up, the whole city has a reason to be warm."</p>

            <p>When it opened in 1891 as the "Royal English Opera Theatre", on the night of its premiere, a mechanical failure on the stage caused the lead actor to get stuck in mid-air and sing the whole play, which became a famous joke in the history of London theatre.</p>
            <p>Requisitioned as a makeshift hospital during World War II, the basement was used to treat the wounded of the Normandy landings. During the renovation in 2016, workers found a note written by a nurse in 1944 stuffed into the cracks in the wall: "Tonight another wounded person is calling Hogwarts in a dream, strange name." (Half a century before the novel!)</p>
