                        <p>On the land of Ying County in Shuozhou, Shanxi, a wooden pagoda stands proudly, transcending nearly a millennium of time, recounting endless tales and legends. This is the Ying County Wooden Pagoda, formally known as the Shakyamuni Pagoda of Fogong Temple. The Ying County Wooden Pagoda is the oldest and tallest wooden pagoda in the world, and it is celebrated alongside the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy and the Eiffel Tower in Paris as one of the 'Three Great Towers of the World'.</p>

                            <p>Description:The Yincheng Wooden Pagoda, also known as the Shakyamuni Pagoda of Fogong Temple, is located at Fogong Temple in the northwest of Yincheng City. It is the oldest and tallest wooden pagoda in the world, recognized alongside the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy and the Eiffel Tower in Paris as one of the 'Three Great Towers of the World.' The wooden pagoda was built during the Liao Dynasty in 1056 AD, making it nearly a thousand years old.</p>

                        <p>The construction of the Wooden Pagoda in Ying County is accompanied by a miraculous legend among the people. It is said that Lu Ban and his sister passed through this area, where his sister challenged him to a contest of skills, claiming she could make twelve pairs of embroidered shoes in one night. Lu Ban, if he could build a twelve-story wooden pagoda in the same timeframe, would be acknowledged as the more skilled. Remarkably, Lu Ban indeed completed the twelve-story pagoda, but after its completion, the ground could not bear the weight, causing the pagoda to sink into the earth. Lu Ban then pushed with his hand, splitting the pagoda into two halves; the upper half was sent flying to what is now Inner Mongolia, while the remaining five floors gradually emerged from the ground and became the present-day Shijia Pagoda. Later, the Jade Emperor, in order to protect Lu Ban's labor, dispatched the God of Fire and the Dragon King to deliver fire-avoidance and water-avoidance pearls respectively. Since then, the wooden pagoda has been able to independently resist fire and water; when floods approached, they would divert around the pagoda and flow in all directions. With the fire-avoidance pearl, the pagoda has never suffered from lightning strikes; even during wartime, when shells hit the pagoda and a fire ignited, it would extinguish in an instant.</p>

                        <p>The architectural skill of the Hanging Monastery is truly remarkable, ingeniously utilizing principles of mechanics and the advantages of the terrain, with cantilevered beams as its foundation, supported by rock to create a stable and intricate wooden framework. The portions that appear to be suspended in mid-air mainly consist of corridors, while the main structure is cleverly embedded within the cliff's caves. The Hanging Monastery perfectly integrates architecture with nature, showcasing a unique sense of harmonious beauty. The entire temple features a layout of "one courtyard and two buildings," with the pavilions and halls distributed at intervals upon the sheer cliffs, creating a striking interplay of heights and clear layers. The two tall buildings with three-eaved, hipped roofs in the north and south rise majestically, standing face to face in mid-air.</p>

                            <p>Description: Xuankong Temple, originally called 'Xuan Kong Ge', is located 4 kilometers southeast of Hunyuan County in Datong City, Shanxi Province, near the Ciyao Gorge of Mount Heng, also known as Jinlong Gorge, on the west side of Cuiping Peak. It is a temple complex that integrates Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Xuankong Temple is one of the earliest existing and relatively well-preserved high-altitude wooden cliff structures in China, recognized as the foremost scenic spot among the Eighteen Scenic Views of Mount Heng.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The historical legends of the Hanging Monastery are profound and far-reaching, with the most famous being the legend of the 'Flying Temple.' It is said that in ancient times, there was a high monk named Huiyuan, who had achieved great success in his cultivation and enlightened himself to the true essence of Buddhism. However, he found that there were no suitable places nearby to build a temple. Therefore, Huiyuan decided to construct a temple on the sheer cliffs, seeking to connect with heaven and earth and attain the highest realm of cultivation. Yet, building the Hanging Monastery was not an easy task. Due to the treacherous terrain, the construction conditions were extremely harsh, and there was almost no flat base for building on the cliffs. Huiyuan faced numerous difficulties, but he did not give up. He led many devotees, using stones, wood, and ropes, tirelessly and progressively constructing the Hanging Monastery. Throughout the entire building process, Huiyuan and his followers persevered against the odds, ultimately succeeding in establishing the temple on the precipice, becoming a miraculous hanging wonder.</p>

The total area covers 2.25 square kilometers. The street layout within the city is shaped like the character '土', and the overall design follows the eight trigrams orientation, composed of four main streets, eight small alleys, and seventy-two winding lanes, thereby creating a Bagua pattern. The South Street, East Street, West Street, Yamen Street, and City God Temple Street form a central business street resembling a character '干'.</p>

                        <p>The ancient city of Pingyao also carries many important historical stories. One of the most talked about is the legend of the "Daughter Wall". Legend has it that in ancient times, an old man and his little granddaughter depended on each other. One day, while the old man was working on the city wall, a very tired migrant worker almost fell off the city wall. Seeing this, the little granddaughter pushed him inward, and as a result, the migrant worker was saved, but the little granddaughter unfortunately fell to her death. In honor of this brave and kind little girl, the craftsmen built a low wall on the city wall and called it the "Daughter Wall". This story not only makes us feel the kindness and bravery of the people of Pingyao, but also makes us full of respect for this ancient city.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The Jin Ancestral Hall is recognized as the first ancestral hall in the world, the earliest existing royal sacrificial garden in China, the culmination of ancient Chinese architectural aesthetics, a comprehensive carrier of the historical context of the Three Jin Dynasty, and a world-class heritage.</p>
                        <p>Jin Ancestral Hall, originally known as Tang Shuyu Ancestral Hall, is located at the foot of the Hanging Urn Mountain and the source of Jinshui 25 kilometers southwest of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province. It was built to commemorate Tang Shuyu, the first prince of the Jin Kingdom in the early years of the Western Zhou Dynasty, and its history can be traced back to the Western Zhou period in the 11th century BC. There is a famous historical allusion here, called "Jiantong Fengdi".</p>
                        <p>According to legend, King Ji Yu of Zhou Cheng and his brother Ji Yu were in a game, and King Cheng cut a sycamore leaf into the shape of a jade gui, and jokingly said that he would seal this land to Ji Yu. Although this was just a joke at first, at the insistence of the historian, Jun did not joke, and King Zhou Cheng finally gave the Tang Land (in the area of present-day Yicheng, Shanxi) to Ji Yu. Ji Yu took Tang as his clan, and later called "Tang Shuyu", during his reign, the Tang country was stable, and the people lived and worked in peace and contentment. After the death of Shu Yu, his son Xie's father succeeded to the throne, and because he moved to the side of Jinshui, he changed the name of the country to "Jin", which officially opened the historical prelude to the first big country in the Spring and Autumn Period - the Jin State.</p>

                            <p>The water mirror platform embodies the four styles of hall, platform, floor and pavilion; From the east, the upper part is the top of the mountain with heavy eaves, which is like a building; The lower part is in the form of a wide palace, and it is a hall again; From the west, the upper part is a single-eaves roll roof, like a pavilion; Underneath is a spacious high platform;</p>
                            <p>This is a special building that combines the hall and the roll shed, the second half of the single-eaves roll shed top floor table is the front desk of the play, facing the temple of the Virgin, surrounded by a corridor, a round window on the left and right of the door, the characteristics of the ancient building in the north are very obvious;
                                It is said that there are many large water tanks buried under the stage, and each two are buckled together to form four "big speakers", which is a method of enhancing the sound effect in ancient times, because with this large urn speaker, the audience can hear the sound on the stage no matter where they stand in the temple.</p>

                        <p>The water mirror platform is the prototype of the small temple that Sun Wukong changed when he fought Erlang God in "Journey to the West". The ancients buried eight large vats on both sides of the stage in front of the stage, using the principle of physical resonance to form a "speaker", which played a role in amplifying the sound when the actors sang。</p>
