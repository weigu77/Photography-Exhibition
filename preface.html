        <h1>Prologue: The Gate of Time and Space</h1>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>This introductory chapter presents the Forbidden City in Beijing, the National Centre for the Performing Arts in China, the Shesheng Tower in Shanxi, and the Tower Bridge in London as the prologue to an exploratory journey. From the grand ancient palaces to modern skyscrapers, the Forbidden City showcases the long history and contemporary style of Chinese architecture; the ancient architectural complex in Shanxi narrates a story of a thousand years; while London's Tower Bridge stands as a steel poem crossing the River Thames. These four iconic structures not only each bear rich cultural and historical significance but also foreshadow the vast domains to be explored in the following four chapters, inviting you to appreciate the brilliant chapters of human civilization.</p>
